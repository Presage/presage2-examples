# Presage2 examples

This project gives a selection of basic example simulations using the [Presage2] simulation library. These examples demonstrate platform features, as well as acting as tutorials for using the platform.

## Examples

 * [GameOfLife] - This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) as a multi-agent simulation. Each cell is an agent who will switch between 'alive' and 'dead' depending on neighbour's states. This implementation is written in [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/).
 * [MANET] - This is a basic simulation of a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork which demonstrates Presage2's inter-agent communication and network simulation capabilities. Agents traverse a 2D space and send communicative messages between each other.
 * [Motion] - Agents moving in a 2D world.
